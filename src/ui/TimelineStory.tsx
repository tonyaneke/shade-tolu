    date: "2010",
    description: `Our story began in 2010, at the University of Port Harcourt.
            I was seated in Basic Hall, just starting my pre-degree program in Petroleum Engineering, when this beautiful young lady walked in — Shade.
            She wore a simple white top and a black skirt, yet there was something effortlessly graceful about her. She smiled, looked around, and then asked softly, "Hello, may I join you?"
            I said yes — not realizing that single moment would mark the beginning of a story far beyond what either of us imagined.
            We didn’t know it then, but that seat in Basic Hall wasn’t just about academics; it was destiny quietly taking its place.
            So, sit back, relax, and let us take you on a journey — one of friendship, timing, and the kind of love that only time could reveal.`,

      "We didn’t say much that day — just exchanged names, courses, and a few polite smiles. But as the weeks went by, life seemed to keep crossing our paths in the most unexpected ways. What began as simple hellos turned into longer conversations, shared jokes, and eventually, a genuine friendship. Before long, we became study partners — spending long hours in the library, sharing notes, and motivating each other to stay focused. At that stage, it was all about academics. Romance wasn’t even a thought; we were just two young dreamers helping each other chase success. Looking back now, it’s beautiful how something so ordinary — shared notes and study sessions — quietly laid the foundation for a story neither of us saw coming.",

      "After completing our one-year Basic Program at the University of Port Harcourt, Shade and I stayed in touch — checking in on each other often and eagerly awaiting the release of the admission list.My heart was set on Petroleum Engineering, while she dreamt passionately about Medicine and Surgery. But as fate would have it, destiny had a different script for us. When the admission list finally came out, we both found our names under Geology — a course neither of us had ever imagined studying. There was excitement, yes, but also a quiet mix of surprise and uncertainty. We had achieved the dream of gaining admission, yet it wasn’t quite the dream we had envisioned. After days of deep thought and prayer, I chose to embrace the new path before me. Interestingly, Shade had come to the same conclusion. We both accepted the offer and began our registration process — together.  Looking back now, it feels almost poetic how life aligned our journeys once again — not just in the same university, but in the same department, with sequential matric numbers: mine 026, hers 027. We even got to sit side by side during exams. Was that the stage being set for our story of love?Move on to the next chapter to find out.",

    description:
      "We’re sorry to disappoint you — no, we didn’t start a romantic relationship.Were there feelings? Yes. Undeniably so. But for reasons of preserving and prioritizing our genuine friendship, I was not willing to jeopardize access to her for expression of my feelings. I chose to be silent over confession. What followed was four years of unspoken emotions wrapped in genuine friendship. We built a bond that was honest, easy, and deeply comforting — a kind of friendship that didn’t need words to be understood. We studied together late into the night, helped each other with assignments, and shared countless moments of laughter, support, and quiet admiration. Life, however, had its own plans. Along the way, we each embarked on separate journeys of love — with different people, in search of something we didn’t realize we already had. We celebrated each other’s highs and offered shoulders during the lows, never crossing the line, yet never truly apart. Looking back, it’s almost poetic how we spent those years side by side, learning not just about rocks and minerals, strikes and deeps, field trips but about patience, timing, and the quiet power of destiny at work behind the scenes.",

      "Then came the NYSC year — that inevitable season where life begins to scatter friends across the country. I was posted to Abuja, while she found herself in Jos. But somehow, it never really felt like we were apart. The distance didn’t break our connection; if anything, it refined it. We shared laughter, stories, and small wins from our new worlds. We were intentional about staying in touch — not out of obligation, but out of genuine care. We encouraged each other’s growth, discussed our career dreams, and found new ways to show up for one another, even from miles away. Adulthood had begun to test us — with its demands, decisions, and uncertainties — yet our friendship only grew deeper. When NYSC came to an end, she moved to Lagos, chasing the next chapter of her life and exploring what the city had in store. I, on the other hand, chose to remain in Abuja, charting my own course and building my path one step at a time. Years went by — yet through it all, our bond remained unshaken. We celebrated milestones together, cheered for each other’s achievements, and watched time turn our friendship into something rare and beautiful. Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve years of friendship…And still, we stood — not knowing that all those years of consistency, patience, and quiet affection were leading us toward something far greater than friendship.",

    description:
      "In our thirteenth year of friendship, something shifted — voice was given to surpressed emotions of over a decade. In what could only be described as an unconventional moment, I finally asked her out. It wasn’t rehearsed or grand — just honest. But that simple question stirred up a flood of emotions and memories, gently unveiling what had been hidden in plain sight all along. We laughed, we reminisced, and then came the question that lingered between smiles and silence — “What took us so long?” Perhaps it was timing. Perhaps it was destiny’s way of preparing us for each other.After years of friendship, shared dreams, and unspoken feelings, we both knew it was time to embrace what had always been there. And so, we took the leap — from friends to lovers — not as strangers discovering something new, but as two souls finally recognizing what life had been quietly writing all these years. Today, when I look at her, I don’t just see the girl from Basic Hall or my friend from Geology class. I see my answered prayer, my constant, my home and safe haven. Thirteen years of friendship, and a lifetime of love ahead.Our story didn’t begin with sparks — it began with friendship.But now, it burns with a flame only time and destiny could have kindled.",
